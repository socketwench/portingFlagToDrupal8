====================

A Reveal.js presentation for the DrupalCorn 2014 session, "Porting Flag to Drupal 8"

Summary
-------

We've all heard about the big changes coming in Drupal 8. And if you maintain a module, you're wondering just how complicated it's going to be to update. Is now even the right time to update? Example modules like Pants can help, but what does a "real" module look like on Drupal 8?

In this session, we'll discuss the tasks, challenges, and choices that you'll encounter when porting your module to Drupal 8. You'll get a broad understanding of the porting process as we touch many of Drupal 8's new and updated APIs. You'll see how Flag module was rebuilt and redesigned to work using 8's updated Entity system, use of plugins to provide for further expandability, and other tips and tricks you can use!

This session will be technical and assumes you are familiar with Drupal 7 development concepts and have a high level understanding of object oriented programming.
